Scifi Things a Day

http://polycount.com/discussion/161312/scifi-things-a-day

Robobear is making scifi art daily for the next month, not specifically for a game, but just to do it. Between modelling space craft and space structures, to futuristic architechture and interiors, Robobear's sci-fi art draws the closest comparison to EVE Online's sometimes unorthodox space ships. There also seems to be some pretty obvious Star Wars influence, probably because of dat Star Wars hype omg JarJar SithLord.

Polyflow I'm guessing is along the lines of prototyping the overall shape of the model with basic shapes before delving into the details of the model. You can see this in some of the timelapse videos that are posted. A decent amount of time is spent playing around with basic shapes to get the right general feel of how the resulting model is going to look.

Because Robobear is creating these pieces without a game in mind, I'm inclined to align the work as closer to concept art than to models that someone might actually use in a game.  Most games usually don't go into the same level of micro detail that is present in a lot of the models presented and the level of greeble and mini-details is pretty impressive to me. Some of the other replies seem to find issue with the models not standing out enough from their backgrounds, but most of the commenters seem to enjoy the modeling work. (Matthew Pon)
