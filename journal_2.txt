The 10 in the 10Print code is the most common starting line number in basic, allowing for additional lines to be inserted during development. Nowadays though, IDE's handle line re-numbering and such for us.

10 Print takes a pseudo-random floating point number between 0 and 1 and adds it to 205.5. The number is automatically rounded either up or down to the nearest integer (205 or 206), and then compared to ASCII code to print the corresponding characters, either a forward or backwards slash. Because the RND function is provided with the number 1, the deterministic nature of the pseudo-random number generator will always provide the same resulting floating point number. Each character is then printed directly after the previous and the program is endlessly executed until the stop key is pressed or the power is cut.

Software studies look at the function, form, and the cultural context of what the code is trying to achieve, whereas platform studies look at the lower computational levels (hardware, operating system) and how the platform being developed for informs the design and production of code for the system. Both of these approaches are extremely relevant to game development, where cultural context and coding form, as well as the specific hardware being developed for (if there even is one) can have serious consequences on design choices.
