Your phone is going off, and you need to snooze it. You're in your room but you're having a hard time distinguishing between what is real and what is a dream because you're sleep walking. While part of the room is recognizable and realistic, other parts of your room are fragments of a dream. You can hear your alarm clock but its too dark to see much.

User Stories: As a player, I want to _______.
Work Tasks: Smaller tasks, what you need to work to implement


Should walking around in one state, should the player move in the other world?

Should the player be fighting to stay awake? Should they be aware of how much time they have left?




As a player, I want to be able to temporarily, "shut off" the dream state
	- Create dream objects that temporarily disappear when the player "forces their eyes open"
	- Be able to "brighten" the scene so that the player can temporarily be more aware of their surroundings
	- The player camera switches between the player character in the room and the player character in the dream
	- The player must be aware of the limited amount of "awake" time that they have left
	- "Awake time" must restore while in the dream world

As a player I want to be both in a dream and wandering my room simultaneously
	- The player is controlling two separate bodies simultaneously 
	- the two separate camera views must be switched between when "forcing your eyes open"

As a player, I must be able to fail.
	- Various objects in the real world may be hazardous to interact with
		- walking out of the window
		- falling into the tub
		- falling down the stairs
	- Player health must be somewhat visible to the user

As a player, I want to be able to pick up things
	- check the distance between the player and the interactable objects
	- on collision give UI hint that player can interact with object
	- The player then presses a button to pick up the object that is in range
	- When close to something, the object should become a child of the player, maybe floating around them
