(a) a 1 sentence premise, 
(b) tell us the character object and "unique interaction", 
(c) tell us about the world and obstacle or gate, and solution (or skill required to master?)


Your phone is going off, and you need to snooze it. You're in your room but you're having a hard time distinguishing between what is real and what is a dream because you're sleep walking. While part of the room is recognizable and realistic, other parts of your room are fragments of a dream. You can hear your alarm clock but its too dark to see much.

User Stories: As a player, I want to _______.
Work Tasks: Smaller tasks, what you need to work to implement


Should walking around in one state, move the player in the other world?

Should the player be fighting to stay awake? Should they be aware of how much time they have left?

Dream state will get progressively more weird each time the player returns 


Dream state is constant brightness,
The player-light will dim and get brighter to signify becoming more and less aware in the real world,

As a player, I want to try and stay in the real world for as long as I can
	- The real world will dim and eventually fade back into dream state
	- The player may attempt to spam a button to fight a losing war to stay awake


As a player, I want to be able to temporarily, "shut off" the dream state
	- Create dream objects that temporarily disappear when the player "forces their eyes open"
	- Be able to "brighten" the scene so that the player can temporarily be more aware of their surroundings
	- The player camera switches between the player character in the room and the player character in the dream
	- The player must be aware of the limited amount of "awake" time that they have left
	- "Awake time" must restore while in the dream world

As a player I want to be both in a dream and wandering my room simultaneously
	- The player is controlling two separate rigidbodies simultaneously 
	- the two separate camera views must be attached to each rigid body
	- the player must have a way to switch between bodies, either voluntarily or involuntarily

As a player, I must be able to both fail and win
	- Various objects in the real world may be hazardous to interact with
		- walking out of the window
		- falling into the tub
		- falling down the stairs
	- There must be an objective that the player can reach or accomplish

As a player, I want to be able to interact with the world(s)
	- on collision give UI hint that player can interact with object
	- The player then presses a button to pick up the object that is in range
	- the player should have some idea about what objects are in inventory, or have been interacted with.




Have different room layouts when in the dream world vs real world
maybe different objectives are only in certain rooms

alarm clock plays every once in a while

Robert's Suggestions?

add a rhythm to the awake timer
	maybe farther away, lowers the consistency of switching
	closer, increase frequency?

tank controls?
switch A and D to rotation instead of mouselook
